## Resources for Grad Applications (2024-25)

*Note: This is mainly targeted towards CS Master's/PhD applications in the US.*<br><br>
Before starting the grad applications journey, it would be good to go through the following two articles. They cover almost all the aspects, from taking exams to writing SOPs to visa prep:  
1. A Monster Guide to Master's in the US (by Prathamesh Sonawane): [link](https://admits.com/blog/monster-guide-to-ms-in-usa)  
2. Lovish Chopra's How I got into Stanford? [link](https://medium.com/@lovishchopra/how-i-got-into-stanford-ms-in-cs-application-experience-tips-and-tricks-4ba1772bb9b)
